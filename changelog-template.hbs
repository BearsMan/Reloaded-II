***1.28.0: .NET 9 and Miscellaneous Improvements***

## Upgraded to .NET 9

Reloaded-II now ships with .NET 9 (currently RC2) as its runtime; given that no major issues have been reported thus far. This should give modders access to new APIs as well as performance improvements.

## Improved: Running protontricks with certain Flatpak installs.

Many people running Protontricks via Flatpak rely on setting an alias to `protontricks-launch` via `~/.bashrc`. In fact, the [install guide recommends this](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/LinuxSetupGuideNewExtra/#installing-protontricks-via-flatpak).

However, the `.desktop` shortcuts generated by the installer previously did not account for this.

```
Exec=protontricks-launch --appid 3847140856 "/home/sewer/Desktop/Reloaded-II - Sonic Heroes/Reloaded-II.exe"
```

Because the command was not ran in a shell, `~/.bashrc` was not being sourced; so the alias would not work for Flatpak users. Installs from the updated installer now create a shortcut that uses `bash` to invoke the command:

```
Exec=bash -ic 'protontricks-launch --appid 3847140856 "/home/sewer/Desktop/Reloaded-II - Sonic Heroes/Reloaded-II.exe"'
```

This should cause `~/.bashrc` to be sourced; and hopefully the alias to work.

Note: Normally running a specific shell is not the best practice, however the whole installer itself is a hack and `bash` is ubiquitous enough that I can't name a distro that doesn't ship it out of the box.

## Improved: Flickering on xwayland

Client side decorations (window glow) has been disabled by default on Linux; this reduces the amount of flicker encountered when running the application via Wine on Xwayland.

It also helps maximize screen real estate, the invisible border should no longer look 'weird' in tiling window managers.

## Fixed: Auto Update Working Directory

Previously if you moved a game, you would need to move both the `EXE Path` and `Working Directory` in the `Edit Application` menu. This caused a lot of issues as users would not notice, and then get non-bootable games.

In this update, I've made the `Working Directory` adjust alongside the `EXE Path`. This preserves the relative path, in other words, if your working directory is 2 folders up, then the new working directory will also be 2 folders up.
